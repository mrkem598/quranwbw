Quranwbw.com is a word-by-word Quran learning website where you can see the translation and transliteration for each word along with audio for each word and each ayah. Quranwbw.com has been made with the desire to help others and myself understand the Holy Quran better.

### Previously...
Quranwbw.com previously used PHP and MySql in the backend to fetch the data from the database and display the results dynamically. I have however decided to switch to a complete static website. The backend is currently being used as the static files generator. 

### The Static Version
This website is the static version which is generated from a custom made generator which takes the data from the backend database and makes static files out of it. This makes the website faster and most importantly, add offline capabilities to it.

### Offline View
Any page that you visit gets cached automatically for faster loading times and also offline view. This is done through the help of Service Workers. However, I'm planning to provide an option to the users to download/cache the whole website on a click of a button.

### Additional Translations
On the previous version of Quranwbw.com, I was able to provide more than 40 different translations for the ayahs but had to remove them when moving to the current static version. I'm planning to add additional translations for ayahs in the near future IN SHA ALLAH.

### Audio Files
The audio files used by Quranwbw.com are [hosted on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/quranwbw/audios) under one repository. If you would like to use these audio files, you are free to clone the repository.

### Contribute
If you feel like contributing, please help me fix any issues regarding the words, translations, transliterations, or the design. You can raise an issue here or contact me on my email.

### Mobile App
I currently don't have any plans on making a mobile app because first, I don't have the knowledge for making mobile applications and second, I don't need to anymore. I've added offline cababilites to Quranwbw.com. However if you still need a mobile application for the word-by-word feature, [brother Imran from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/imran_sca) has made an iOS app which includes this feature (and many other). [Check out his post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/ag58k9/assalamu_alaikum_i_have_developed_a_free_no_ads/) or [download his app from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/learn-islam-pro/id1236412299?mt=8).
