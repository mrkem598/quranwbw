Quranwbw.com is a word-by-word Quran learning website where you can see the translation and transliteration for each word along with audio for each word and each ayah. Quranwbw.com has been made with the desire to help others and myself understand the Holy Quran better.

### Previously...
Quranwbw.com previously used PHP and MySQL in the backend to fetch the data from the database and display the results dynamically. I have however decided to switch to a complete static website. The backend is currently being used as the static files generator. 

### The Static Version
This website is the static version which is generated from a custom made generator which takes the data from the backend database and makes static files out of it. This makes the website faster and most importantly, add offline capabilities to it.

### Offline View
When you visit Quranwbw.com, the whole website gets cached automatically for faster loading times and also offline view. You don't have to manually install or download anything since this is done automatically in the background.

### Additional Translations
On the previous version of Quranwbw.com, I was able to provide more than 40 different translations for the ayahs but had to remove them when moving to the current static version. I'm planning to add additional translations for ayahs in the near future IN SHA ALLAH.

### Audio Files
The audio files used by Quranwbw.com are hosted [here on Github](https://github.com/quranwbw) under multiple repositories. If you would like to use these audio files, you are free to clone them on your account.

### Mobile App
I currently don't have any plans on making a mobile app because one, I don't have the knowledge for making mobile applications and second, I don't need to anymore since I've added offline cababilites to Quranwbw.com. However if you still need a mobile application for the word-by-word feature, [brother Imran from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/imran_sca) has made an iOS app which includes this feature (and many other). [Check out his post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/ag58k9/assalamu_alaikum_i_have_developed_a_free_no_ads/) or [download his app from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/learn-islam-pro/id1236412299?mt=8).
