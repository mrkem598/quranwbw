### Bismillahi Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim
Quranwbw.com is a word-by-word Quran learning website where you can see the translation and transliteration for each word along with audio for each word and each ayah. Quranwbw.com has been made with the desire to help others and myself understand the Holy Quran.

### The Static Version
This website is the static version which is generated from a custom made generator which takes the data from the backend database and throws them into a static file. This makes the website faster and can be easily downloaded by anyone else for offline view.

### Offline View
Any page that you visit gets cached automatically for faster loading times and also offline view. This is done through Service Workers. However if you want, you can download the whole repository on your computer so that you don't have to visit each page manually. However, I'm planning to provide an option to the users to download/cache the whole website on a click of a button.

### Audio Files
The audio files used by this website are hosted on different repositories. If you would like to use, you are free to clone these repositories and use them for your own use.

### Contribute
This website was developed by a single person and it's a lot of work to add new features, fix any issues or make any changes to the database. Hence, I would really appreciate if someone would like to contribute to Quranwbw.com by helping me improve the code, the database or the design.

### Mobile App
I currently don't have any plans on making a mobile app because first, I don't have the knowledge for making mobile applications and second, I don't need to anymore. I've added offline cababilites to Quranwbw.com. However if you still need a mobile application for the word-by-word feature, [brother Imran from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/imran_sca) has made an iOS app which includes this feature. [Check out his post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/ag58k9/assalamu_alaikum_i_have_developed_a_free_no_ads/) or [download his app from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/learn-islam-pro/id1236412299?mt=8).
